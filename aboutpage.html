        <h1>About Late The Label</h1>
    <h3>Late the Label, designed by Lara Jane is to become the future model for design. We design our garments to be timeless and fashion forward. </h3>
    <p>We make our garments with locally sourced fabric with the hope in mind that the material would be different everytime the design is made so that your handmade piece is a unique work of art that can't be replicated. 
    </p>
    <p>We make our clothes upon recieving order confirmation so we don't waste material and create waste, it's slow but haven't you heard?...</p>
    <h2>Slow is the new fast.</h2>
